# CMOS-Circuit-Design

Circuit design involves arranging transistors  and resistors to create logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR), which are then combined in a particular fashion to form complex, functional digital circuits like microprocessors.
Example : CMOS Inverter circuit made of using -
          One PMOS transistor
          One NMOS transistor
