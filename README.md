# CMOS-Circuit-Design

Circuit design involves arranging transistors  and resistors to create logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR), which are then combined in a particular fashion to form complex, functional digital circuits like microprocessors. <br/>
Example : 
- CMOS Inverter circuit made of using  <br/>
          - One PMOS transistor  <br/>
          - One NMOS transistor <br/>
